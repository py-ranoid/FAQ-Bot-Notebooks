    "### About WMD\n",
    "Word Mover's Distance is a method that to measure distance/similarity between two documents, even when they have no words in common. To measure distance between words, it needs embeddings, (word2vec, in this case). WMD was presented by Matt Kusner et al. in 2015 ([Paper](proceedings.mlr.press/v37/kusnerb15.pdf)).\n",
    "\n",
    "![WMD Results](http://vishalgupta.me/NLP-Notebooks/img/WMD_results.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does it work ?\n",
    "WMD adapts the [earth mover’s distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_mover%27s_distance) to the space of documents: the distance between two texts is given by the total amount of “mass” needed to move the words from one side into the other, multiplied by the distance the words need to move. So, starting from a measure of the distance between different words, we can get a principled document-level distance\n",
